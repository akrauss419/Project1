# Bruce's Nautical Minesweeper

The object of the game is for the player to successfully navigate his/her way through the minefield, a 10x10 grid, without detonating one of the 10 mines randomly placed and hidden across the grid. The player uses the right-click on his/her mouse to mark each square believed to contain a mine, successfully avoiding harm. Once all 10 mines are correctly marked, the player wins the game. If any one of those mines is clicked, or detonated, the player loses. The player's score is determined by the number of seconds the timer reaches once the 10th marker is correctly placed, ending the game.

According to the online tech-focused publication TechRadar, Minesweeper was created by Microsoft in the 1990s, but others beliee the game was largely inspired by a lesser-known game developed in the early 1980s.

The theme of this version of the game is inspired by the Pixar film Finding Nemo, when the movie's protagonists, Marlin and Dory, come across three sharks at a sunken submarine site surrounded by World War II era sea mines. The leader of the group is a great white shark named Bruce.

# Next Steps

Writing code that does not allow for the first square clicked in the minefield to detonate a mine.

Writing code that prevents the timer from starting until the first square in the minefield is clicked.

Adding more visual elements to the webpage. There's a decent amount of negative space to the left and right of the minefield, so adding some extra images and/or animation would be a nice touch. I could also add some more interactive functionality to the gameplay when the player hovers over a square on the minefield, etc.

Adding more sound to the game, such as a specific sound for each click event and when the player wins.
